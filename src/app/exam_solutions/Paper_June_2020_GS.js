            CAD (computer aided design) can be defined as, "The use of computer systems to assist in the creation, 
            modification, analysis or optimization of a design." Computer aided design is the technology concerned 
            with the integrated design activities using a digital computer. This includes computer generation and 
            modification of graphic images on a video display, analysis of design data, electronic storage and 
            retrieval of design information, and printing these designs as a hard copy on a plotter or printer. 
            The generation of design drawings interactively by the user supplying information to the computer via 
            commands or with a menu-driven series of instructions is called computer-aided drafting. These drawings 
            can easily be edited, manipulated, and stored for future usage.
            <br />
            Engineering design is an interactive process and when it is performed on drawing boards and includes 
            their documentation, it is quite cumbersome and time-consuming. Today in the era of rapid technological 
            changes, product innovation, greater response to customer requirements, CAD gives an innovative and 
            efficient system for design.
            <br />
            CAD has the following advantages over traditional methods of design:
            <br />
            (i) Computer-aided design (CAD) is faster and gives more accurate results than conventional methods.
            <br />
            (ii) Developing the design of a component and associated drafting is a very easy task with CAD.
            <br />
            (iii) Manipulation of various dimensions, attributes, and distances of drawing elements is very easy. 
            This makes CAD the most useful designing tool.
            <br />
            (iv) By using CAD, it is not necessary to redraw any design or part of it for further usage. A component 
            once designed can be copied anywhere for further references.
            <br />
            (v) Various geometric properties, including dimensions of various components, their tolerance and 
            interference with each other, can be checked accurately, without making their models and prototypes.

            A drawing may be modified or edited either during its preparation or during the revision of design. In AutoCAD, editing commands can be of
            the following two types:
            <br />
            (i) Commands used to modify the entities, e.g., ERASE, UNDO, REDO, SELECT, ROTATE, CHAMFER, etc.
            <br />
            (ii) Commands used to make copies of the drawings, e.g., COPY, MIRROR, OFFSET, ARRAY, etc.
            <br />
            <b>(i) Move:</b> MOVE command is used to move one or more existing drawing entities from one location in drawing to another. 
   To invoke MOVE command, click MOVE from the Home tab's Modify panel or type MOVE at the command prompt. 
   Command line sequence is as follows Command: MOVE Select objects: Use an object selection method and press Enter when finished
   Specify base point or Displacement Specify a base point or enter d Specify second point or  Specify a point or press Enter
   The two points that has been specified define a vector that indicates how
	 far the selected objects to be moved and in what direction. If Enter has been pressed at the Specify second point prompt, the first point is interpreted as a relative X, Y, Z displacement. 
	 Co-ordinates, grid snaps, object snaps and other tools can be used to move objects with precision..
            <br />
            <b>(ii) Mirror:</b>  MIRROR command creates a mirror image of the selected geometry element. 
  This command creates mirror images of entities by reflecting them symmetrically with reference to a defined axis. 
  Mirroring can be done about X or Y-axis, and also about a defined line or any two points. 
  It allows the option of move or copy the original entities within the drawing.
  Command line sequence is as follows Command: MIRROR Select objects: Select an object
  Specify first point of mirror line: Specify a point (1) Specify second point of mirror line: Specify a point (2) The two specified points become the end points of a line about which the selected objects are reflected. Delete source objects? [Yes/No] N: Enter y or n, or press Enter Yes Places the reflected image into the drawing and deletes the original objects. 
  No Places the reflected image into the drawing and retains the original objects.
            <br />
            <b>(iii) Hatch:</b> HATCH command fills an area defined by lines, arcs. circles, or polylines with either a predefined pattern, a user defined pattern, or
  a solid or simple non-associative hatch pattern. Boundaries of a hatch can be
  specified by one of the following methods 
  (a) Specify a point in an area that is enclosed by objects. 
  (b) Select objects that enclose an area. 
  (c) Drag a hatch pattern into an enclosed area from a tool palette or design center. The procedure to hatch is as follows - 
  1. Click Home tabâ Draw panel â Hatch A Hatch and Gradient dialog box appears. 
  2. In the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, click Add: Pick points 
  3. Now in drawing, specify a point inside each area that needs to be hatched, and then press Enter. This point is known as the internal point. 
  4. In the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, in Hatch tab, the swatch box shows the preview of the pattern that will be applied. To change the pattern, select another pattern from the Pattern list.
  5. In the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, make adjustments,
  6. Under Draw Order, click one of the options. Draw order of the hatch can be changed, so that the hatch is drawn either behind or in front of the hatch boundary, or behind or in front of all other objects. 
  7. Click OK. 
            <br />
            <b>(iv) Offset:</b> OFFSET command creates an object parallel to and at a specified distance from the original. In other words OFFSET command is used to draw parallel lines, polylines, concentric circles, arc, etc. The command prompt sequence is Command: OFFSET Offset distance or Through current 
  (a) Offset Distance Option: In this option, we have to specify the offset distance and the side to offset. 
  Command prompt sequence, for constructing a straight line parallel to a given line AB and at a distance of 2 units towards right as shown in
  Command: OFFSET Offset distance or Through default: 2 Select object to offset: (Select line AB) Side to offset?:
  (Pick point P) Select object to offset: Offset distance can also be entered by picking two points using cursor.
  AutoCAD will measure the distance between these two points and use it as the offset distance.
  (b) Through Option In A through option an offset point is specified instead of specifying the offset distance. A circle drawn concentric to a given circle and passing through an offset point is shown in
            <br />
            <b>(v) Copy:</b>The COPY command is used to duplicate one or more existing drawing entities at another location without erasing the original one. Copy command can be invoked by clicking the Copy tool in the Home tab's Modify panel or by typing COPY at the command prompt. 
  The command line sequence for COPY command is as follows Ad Download to read ad-free Command: COPY Select objects: Select objects by an object selection method Current setting: Copy mode = current Specify base point or Displacement/mOde/Multiple Displacement Specify a base point or enter an option Specify second point or  use first point as displacement : Specify a point or press Enter
  Function of various options of COPY command are as follows
   (a) Displacement Specifies a relative distance and direction using co-ordinates.
  Specify displacement last value Enter co-ordinates to represent a vector 
  (b) Mode-Controls whether the command repeats automatically. 
  This setting is controlled by the COPYMODE system variable. Enter a copy mode option Single/Multiple current  Enter s or m
  (c) Multiple Overrids the single mode setting. The COPY command is set to repeat automatically for the duration of the command. This setting is controlled by the COPYMODE system variable. 
  Multiple option is displayed only when copy mode is set to single..

            a) <b>Orthographic Projection</b> = If the lines or projectors are drawn parallel to each other, but perpendicular to the plane of projection, the projection thus obtained is known as orthographic projection.
            The engineers use the orthographic system of projection for describing true shapes of different objects,
            and is therefore universally used in engineering drawing. Practical application of this method of describing an object results in a drawing consisting of a number of systematically arranged views that produce the object's exact shape.
            <br />
            b) <b>Traces of a line</b> = When a line is inclined to a plane, it will meet that plane, produced if necessary. The point at which the line or line produced meets the plane is called its trace. The point of intersection of the line or line produced with H.P. is called horizontal trace (H.T.) and that with V.P. is called vertical trace (V.T.). The V.T. is a point in V.P. and its top view (v) must be on the XY line, on a projector drawn perpendicular to the XY line, through V.T. Similarly, H.T. is a point on H.P. and its elevation (4) must lie on the XY line, where the projector drawn through H.T. and perpendicular to XY line meets it.
