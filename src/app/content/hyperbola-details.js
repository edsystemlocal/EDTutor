      <br/>
      A hyperbola is a curve that appears in engineering and design.<br/> 
      It is formed when a cone is cut by a plane in a specific way.<br/>
      A hyperbola is defined as a set of points where the difference in distances to two fixed points, <br/>
      called foci, is always the same. Hyperbolas can open up and down or left and right.<br/>

      Applications of Hyperbolas :- <br/>
      <br/>
      Hyperbolas are used in various fields, including:<br/>
      <br/>
        •	Comet paths: Some comets follow hyperbolic orbits in space.<br/>
        •	Supersonic booms: The shockwaves from objects moving faster than sound can be modelled as hyperbolas.<br/>
        •	Ancient architecture: Some old pillars and designs use hyperbolic shapes.<br/>
        •	Cooling towers: The shape of natural draft cooling towers in power plants is based on hyperbolas to improve airflow.<br/>

      How to Draw a Hyperbola :-<br/>
      <br/>
        1.	Place the focus: Position the focus point on a centre line that crosses the directrix (a fixed line).<br/>
        2.	Find the vertex: Divide the distance between the focus and the directrix to locate the vertex, which is the turning point of the curve.<br/>
        3.	Mark additional points: <br/>
           o	Draw lines parallel to the directrix.<br/>
           o	Use these lines to find other points that lie on the hyperbola.<br/>
        4.	Connect the points: Join all the points smoothly to create the hyperbolic shape.<br/>

      Hyperbolas are important in science, architecture, and technology, with practical uses in many areas of engineering and design.<br/>
