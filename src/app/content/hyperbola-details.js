      <b>hyperbola Details :- </b>
      A hyperbola is a curve that appears in engineering and design.
      It is formed when a cone is cut by a plane in a specific way.
      A hyperbola is defined as a set of points where the difference in distances to two fixed points,
      called foci, is always the same. Hyperbolas can open up and down or left and right.<br/><br/>
      <b>Applications of Hyperbolas :-</b>
      <b>Hyperbolas are used in various fields, including:</b>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Comet paths: Some comets follow hyperbolic orbits in space.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Supersonic booms: The shockwaves from objects moving faster than sound can be modelled as hyperbolas.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Ancient architecture: Some old pillars and designs use hyperbolic shapes.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Cooling towers: The shape of natural draft cooling towers in power plants is based on hyperbolas to improve airflow.<br/><br/>
     <b> How to Draw a Hyperbola :-</b>
      &nbsp; 1. Place the focus: Position the focus point on a centre line that crosses the directrix (a fixed line).<br/>
      &nbsp; 2. Find the vertex: Divide the distance between focus and the directrix to locate the vertex, which is the turning point of curve.<br/>
      &nbsp; 3. Mark additional points: <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Draw lines parallel to the directrix.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Use these lines to find other points that lie on the hyperbola.<br/>
      &nbsp; 4. Connect the points: Join all the points smoothly to create the hyperbolic shape.<br/><br/>
      Hyperbolas are important in science, architecture, and technology, with practical uses in many areas of engineering and design.<br/>
