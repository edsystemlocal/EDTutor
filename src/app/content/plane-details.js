        Plane Details :- <br/> 

        A plane is a two-dimensional geometric entity characterized by having only length and breadth, with its thickness always 
        being negligible. Various plane figures, such as squares, rectangles, circles, pentagons, hexagons, and other shapes, 
        are examples of different configurations of planes.<br/>
        Planes are fundamental in geometry and engineering drawings, providing the basis for creating projections, sections,
         and visual representations of objects.<br/>

         Characteristics of a Plane :-<br/>
          1. A plane is a flat surface that represents a set of points in geometry.<br/>
          2. It exists in two dimensions (length and breadth).<br/>
          3. To define a plane, three non-collinear points (points not lying on the same straight line) are required.<br/>
          4. It is essential in engineering drawing for creating projections and sectional views.<br/>

          Uses:-<br />
          • Projection Drawing: A plane is used to represent the views of an object (top, front, side).<br />
          • Sectional Views: A plane is used to cut through an object to reveal its internal details.<br />
