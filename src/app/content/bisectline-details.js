      <b>Bisect Line Definition :-</b> Bisecting lines and angles means dividing a line or angle into two equal parts. This is a basic geometric skill used in many fields like drawing, architecture, engineering, and design. It helps ensure accuracy, balance, and symmetry when creating objects or structures.<br/><br/>
      <b>For example </b> when designing a building or a mechanical part, bisecting ensures that measurements are correct and that the design is well-aligned. This is important for both the strength and appearance of the structure. Itâ€™s also useful for dividing spaces equally, finding the middle of a line, or drawing straight, perpendicular lines.<br/>
Knowing how to bisect accurately is important for creating clear and precise designs, whether for simple sketches or detailed plans. It helps professionals, like architects and engineers, make sure their designs are proportional, functional, and visually appealing. This skill is an essential part of creating reliable and efficient structures in various fields.<br/>
