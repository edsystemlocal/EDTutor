<b> Involute Definition :-  </b>
An involute is a geometric curve that is generated when a taut thread is unwound from a circle or a polygon. The thread, while being unwound, remains tight and tangential to the base circle or the sides of the polygon at every point during the process.
 <br/><br/>
 <b>1. Base Circle or Polygon :-  </b>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • The base is either a circle (most common in practical applications) or a polygon. <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • The thread unwinds from this base, maintaining contact with it. <br/><br/>
 <b>2. Taut Thread :-  </b>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • The thread is always tight (not slack) during the unwinding process.<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • This ensures that the curve formed is precise and mathematically consistent.<br/><br/>
 <b>3. Tangential Contact :-  </b>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • At any point of the unwinding process, the thread remains tangential to the base.<br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; • This means the thread touches the base at a single point, forming the foundation of the curve.<br/>
